                    The sea is full of mysteries and wonders, but also of dangers and horrors. There are many sea monsters that lurk in the depths, waiting for their prey. Some of them are well-known, such as the **kraken**, a colossal squid that can drag ships to the bottom, or the **leviathan**, a massive whale that can swallow whole islands. Others are more obscure, such as the **akhlut**, a creature from Inuit mythology that can switch between a wolf and an orca, or the **scylla**, a monster from Greek mythology that has six heads, each with a mouth full of sharp teeth. These sea monsters are the stuff of nightmares, and only the bravest sailors dare to face them.

                <p>
                    Pada zaman prasejarah, ada seekor teripang raksasa yang menghuni lautan. Monster ini memiliki panjang lebih dari 10 meter dan berat lebih dari satu ton. Tubuhnya berwarna hitam pekat dan berlendir, dengan banyak duri yang menonjol dari permukaannya. Namun, yang paling menakutkan adalah gigi-giginya yang tajam dan bergerigi, yang bisa menghancurkan apa saja yang masuk ke mulutnya. Monster ini adalah pemangsa yang ganas dan rakus, yang tidak segan-segan menyerang hewan lain yang lebih besar darinya. Teripang raksasa ini adalah salah satu makhluk paling mengerikan yang pernah hidup di bumi.

                        In prehistoric times, there was a giant sea cucumber that inhabited the ocean. This monster had a length of more than 10 meters and a weight of more than one ton. Its body was dark black and slimy, with many spines protruding from its surface. But the most terrifying thing was its sharp and serrated teeth, which could destroy anything that entered its mouth. This monster was a fierce and greedy predator, which did not hesitate to attack other animals that were bigger than it. This giant sea cucumber was one of the most horrifying creatures that ever lived on earth.
